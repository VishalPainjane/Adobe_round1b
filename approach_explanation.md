# Methodology & Approach

## Problem Analysis

The challenge of intelligent document retrieval from PDF collections requires a sophisticated understanding of both document structure and semantic content. Traditional keyword-based approaches fail to capture the nuanced relationships between user intent and document information, particularly in specialized domains like travel planning where context and persona significantly influence relevance.

## Architectural Design Philosophy

Our solution implements a multi-stage pipeline that separates concerns while maintaining semantic coherence throughout the processing chain. The architecture follows three core principles: **structure preservation**, **semantic understanding**, and **contextual ranking**.

### Structure Preservation

Document intelligence begins with accurate structural understanding. Our PDF parsing strategy employs font-based heuristics to identify hierarchical relationships, treating documents as structured knowledge repositories rather than flat text streams. The `parse_and_chunk_with_page_accuracy` function implements overlapping windowed chunking that maintains cross-boundary context while preserving section affiliations. This approach ensures that semantic relationships spanning multiple paragraphs or pages remain intact during processing.

### Semantic Understanding

The core innovation lies in our dual-model approach to semantic processing. We leverage `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for high-quality embedding generation, chosen for its balance between computational efficiency and semantic accuracy. The model's 384-dimensional embeddings capture fine-grained semantic relationships essential for domain-specific retrieval tasks.

Query understanding utilizes `t5-small` for intelligent expansion, generating multiple semantic variations of user queries. This addresses the vocabulary mismatch problem where users and documents employ different terminology for identical concepts. The T5 model's text-to-text architecture enables natural query reformulation while preserving intent.

### Contextual Ranking

Our ranking algorithm implements multi-query aggregation using maximum pooling across expanded queries. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining precision. Cosine similarity computation operates on normalized embeddings, providing scale-invariant relevance scoring that adapts to document length variations.

The persona-aware filtering mechanism weights results based on role-specific relevance indicators. For travel planning personas, sections containing actionable information (itineraries, recommendations, logistics) receive enhanced scoring compared to purely descriptive content.

## Technical Optimizations

The system employs several performance optimizations critical for production deployment. Model caching during Docker build eliminates cold-start latency, while batch processing of embeddings maximizes GPU utilization efficiency. Memory management strategies include on-demand loading and garbage collection between processing stages.

Error handling implements graceful degradation, ensuring partial results remain available even when individual document processing fails. This resilience is crucial for enterprise environments where document quality varies significantly.

## Validation & Accuracy

Our approach has been validated against travel document collections, demonstrating consistent extraction of relevant planning information. The semantic similarity threshold of 0.3 balances precision and recall, empirically determined through evaluation on diverse document types. The system successfully handles multi-document synthesis, combining information from disparate sources into coherent recommendations.

The containerized deployment ensures reproducible results across environments while maintaining security through network isolation. This approach supports enterprise integration requirements while preserving sensitive document
